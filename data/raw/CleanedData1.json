  "universityDescription": "Coventry University gained its university status in 1992. Since then it has worked tirelessly to become a global enterprise, establishing multiple campuses and initiatives across the world, including the Coventry University Group. We are a forward-looking, modern university with a proud tradition as a provider of high quality education and a focus on applied research. Our students benefit from state-of-the-art equipment and facilities in all academic disciplines including health, design and engineering laboratories, performing arts studios and computing centres. We have been chosen to host three national Centres of Excellence in Teaching and Learning which has enabled us to invest substantial sums of money in health, design and mathematics. Our city-centre campus is continually developing and evolving, and we have plans for further investment in it over the next few years. We are a major presence in Coventry, which contributes to the city's friendly and vibrant atmosphere and also enables us to foster successful business partnerships. Through our links with leading edge businesses and organisations in the public and voluntary sectors, our students are able to access project and placement opportunities that enhance their employability on graduation. The University is committed to the highest standards of openness, integrity and accountability. We are committed to conducting our affairs in a responsible and transparent way and to take account of the requirements of our funding bodies for the proper use of public funds and for the standards required in public life. Our contribution to the life of the city does not stop at the provision of education. It also supports jobs, leads enterprise and innovation, delivers ground-breaking research, encourages diversity, and opens up opportunities for all. Coventry University is a proud signatory of the Technician Commitment, an initiative sponsored by the Gatsby Foundation and covering a number of University and Research Institutions which identifies four areas/themes which will ensure greater visibility, recognition, career development and sustainability for technicians across all disciplines. The University acknowledges the immense importance of technical roles and the impact on research and the student experience, and so was keen to become a signatory of the Commitment. We conducted a Stage 1 Self-Assessment and published our initial 2-year Action Plan in 2019. It set out goals aligned to the four themes with indicative timeframes; unfortunately these did change as a result of the COVID pandemic and as a result, we submitted our Stage 2 Self-Assessment and 3-year Action Plan in December 2022. Both plans were developed in conjunction with our Technician Community and aim to firmly embed the Technician Commitment into all aspects of University life and develop a community of professional practice for our technicians. Engagement and involvement from the Technician Community is vital to the success of the 3-year plan, so we will be continuing to create opportunities for our technicians to meet and network on a regular basis. We have a Technician Commitment Working Group which meets as a minimum once a term and includes Champions who are technicians from the Faculties and Research Centres, as well as Theme Leads.",
